## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why
Web and mobile app to track the status of ventilators in public hospitals and provide volunteers access to technical resources.

Main functionalities:
- Map-based ventilator tracking dashboard
- Repair Guides
- Specialists contact info

### 💥 Problem
Mechanical ventilation may be needed in the treatment of the more severe respiratory distress cases of the COVID-19 disease (https://openwho.org/courses/introduction-to-ncov).
One major concern is the shortage of proper patient care equipment in the worst-case scenario of the COVID-19 outbreak, especially in the countries with low Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/universal-health-coverage-(uhc)).
Therefore, it is important to track the availability of this kind of equipment in a given geographic region, including their operational conditions.
If repair is needed, volunteers will need access to verified technical resources such as repair guides provided/reviewed by specialists to perform the proper intervention and safe deployment.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis
General availability of technical information will attract and enable volunteers to provide appropriate repair.

### 🤔 Assumptions
- There is a reasonable (?) amount of out-of-order ventilators.
- Public hospitals will share their ventilator inventory info and needs.
- Public hospitals will allow volunteers to access and repair their equipment.
- There aren't any regulatory restrictions to named volunteers to repair healthcare equipment.
- Volunteers have previous electronics/mechanical equipment repair knowledge.
- If part replacement is needed, some sort of 'crowdfunding' will be arranged by the local community of volunteers.

## 💻Implementation Suggestion

### V1
(briefing)
- Map-based ventilator tracking dashboard
- Login screen:
	- 'Hospital' user
	- 'Volunteer' user
	- 'Specialist' user
- Post/Update screen:
	- No. of ventilators, status, contact info
	- Call for volunteers
	- Call for parts
- Resources screen:
	- Repair Guides (like the ones from iFixit.com)
	- Specialists contact info (volunteers may access them when needed)

### What it is
(what are we testing and the hypothesis we’re testing)
Web and mobile app to track the status of ventilators in public hospitals.
