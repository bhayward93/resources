## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

Now more than ever, we should all be practicing social distancing by isolating ourselves and being in contact with as few people as possible.

Despite this, people still go out and come into contact with others for their own enjoyment, despite the fact that this does not benefit the greater good.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

We can cheaply make static websites with simple messages encouraging social isolation. See example below in Implementation Suggestion.



### 🤔 Assumptions
- These sites will be shared on social media and spread influence in that way.
- We will have some artistic ideas to implement.
- We will have $ for domain registration and static hosting.
- We have frontend talent to present these informative messages in visually pleasing ways.

## 💻Implementation Suggestion

### V1
#### Example
- A minimal stylish site with the text "Is it OK if I do ... ?" and an input form.
- When the form is submitted, a gentle message appears suggesting social isolation, and some informative links.

### What it is
- An artful informative message encouraging people to isolate and not engage in unnecessary contact with others.
- For lack of a better term, an attempt at viral marketing of the social distancing message.
- A static website.
- A lot of very small effort static sites to raise awareness, hosted through IPFS.


### What it is not
- An API
- A place where news or information is put.
### Design
- TBD
## 💪 Impact of Potential Solution
- More people practice social distancing.
- Static sites get a lot of traffic or reach a lot of eyes via social media.

## 🙌 Criteria for Success
- A site gets 100,000 hits.
- A tweet with one of the sites gets 10,000 likes.
## 😅 Known Issues
- We need artistic ideas to convey this message in novel ways!
